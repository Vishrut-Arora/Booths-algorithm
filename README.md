# Booths-algorithm
Booth's multiplication algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary numbers in two's complement notation efficiently.
This uses arithmatic right shift thus reducing the number of repeated additions and subtractions as in case of normal multiplication.
The documentation file contains variables description and flow of code.
